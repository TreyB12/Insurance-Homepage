        I would like to say a big Thank You to everyone at Aspen. As a new business owner, there was so much to do and all of the policy information can be very confusing. Rob sat down with me and explained it all in great detail and got it done quickly and with reasonable rates. Also, anytime I have a question, Lisa is always quick to help me out. THANK YOU ASPEN!!!

        I have been working with Rob Boyd and Aspen Insurance for eleven years and they have been phenomenal for us. They have not only saved us money on our premium but they also helped us find holes in our coverage that were pretty scary. Their customers is awesome - both him and his team are available to answer questions at all times. (do you have your current agents personal cell phone #?) we are extremely happy with the service that we have gotten from Aspen Insurance and highly recommend them.

        As a local small business owner I know how important it is to provide quality service to all your customers. That is why I will only do business with Rob Boyd and Aspen Insurance. He has advised me on the correct coverage I need to protect me at a cost effective price. He and his staff turn around all certificate requests and questions with in a few hours. If you own a small business I strongly suggest you pick up the phone and give Rob a call today.

        I always shied away from insurance people because of their one way attitude and “sales” approach. Rob treated me like family and realized the importance of not just following up, but following through. His attention to detail and courteous behavior on top of saving me over 25% on my insurance (Auto/Home/Boat) was much appreciated now my whole family and my Business is with Aspen Insurance and that speaks for itself!
